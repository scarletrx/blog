#THE LUXURY OF CULTURE: THOUB ZAHRA

![001][1]

Our identities, for ourselves and within society, are always connected to our ethnic background or cultural interests. As I have stated in previous posts, traditional ways of dress and living have frequently been abandoned by younger generations. However, there has been a growing interest in cultural traditions in recent years. Within the Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region, more young adults are embracing their cultural heritage of traditional dress and customs to preserve their culture, while living in a modern world. From artistic twists on cultural sayings, symbols, and even foods, many designers are creating exciting brands that are attracting followings within and outside their respective locales. And today’s featured guest is fueling this movement by providing her own spin on Kuwaiti traditional dresses for the younger generation of women in her country. Allow me to introduce you to Zainab, the designer behind THOUB ZAHRA.

The idea for THOUB ZAHRA started in 1995. During this time, the traditional Kuwaiti thoub, sometimes called thoub nashal, was mostly worn by older women and has often been a sign of prestige and wealth depending on the fabrics and embroidery used to adorn the garment. Zainab mentions that recently, she has noticed many young women are interested in having a completely traditional look for their milcka or wedding engagement parties. And that’s when the idea clicked. She says:

&gt; _"I just thought of bringing our [Kuwaiti] culture and tradition back in a way [that is] mixed with our modern lifestyle."_

So she decided to start THOUB ZAHRA this year, focusing on designs that incorporate high quality materials and hand embroidery made using pure golden zari thread. This kind of thread never tarnishes or fades, giving each THOUB ZAHRA garment the ability to become an heirloom and family tradition to be passed down from generation to generation. Despite being in business online for only a little more than a month, THOUB ZAHRA has been well received and continues to thrive in delivering quality heirloom garments.

Looking through fashion history, several designers have been influenced by the traditional thoub and caftan, especially British fashion designer Thea Porter. Her caftans were collected by several celebrities, but her most adoring fan was the late Dame Elizabeth Taylor ([see the Christie’s auction][2]). I have loved the traditional dress of various cultures for quite some time and I have a special place in my heart for thoub nashal. They are comfortable and make dressing for a special occasion gracefully effortless. Check out more details of the THOUB ZAHRA collection below:
