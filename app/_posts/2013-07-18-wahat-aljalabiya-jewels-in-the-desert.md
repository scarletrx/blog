#WAHAT AL-JALABIYA: JEWELS IN THE DESERT

![001_intro][1]

Ramadaan is finally here. And what does it bring along with fasting, reflection, and worship? Iftar gatherings. And some of these gatherings require a bit more formal attire than our everyday abayat (overgarments). If you have been looking for a garment with a bit more sparkle and flare, then allow me to introduce you to Wahat Al-Jalabiya.

With over 10 million jalabiyat (party and special occasion dresses) sold in 79 branches throughout the Middle East, Wahat Al-Jalabiya has been a key player within the Gulf fashion industry for 20 years. The company prides itself in providing a wide selection of apparel for all tastes, from casual to formal styles. All of their garments are made from some of the best materials available, designed by a team of talented fashion designers. Hand beaded and embroidered embellishments grace their garments, along with exciting prints, ranging from vintage to bold, colorful styles.

In 2011, Wahat Al-Jalabiya launched their online store, opening the door to expand their business internationally. To further attract international customers and increase their exposure within the United States, Wahat Al-Jalabiya collaborated with American hijabi fashion blogger and [Aquila Style Magazine][3] (Indonesia) contributor, Yasemin [(YaztheSpaz)][4], for a lovely editorial spread and interview with US-based [Azizah Magazine][5].

I am particularly drawn to their Luxury and Limited Edition collections. They are elegant jalabiyat with graceful draping and hand-embellishments. Anyone who knows me, knows I love an elegant, floor-length garment for hosting and Wahat Al-Jalabiya definitely delivers. My favorites of these two collections are below:

In addition to jalabiyat, Wahat Al-Jalabiya also offers kaftan, jalabib (casual dresses), hijab (scarves), and even bridal lingerie and nightwear. With locations in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, their collections are readily available for viewing and purchasing. For orders outside the Gulf region, orders can be made at their online store. To view more of their collections, find the nearest location, or make an order online, please visit their [website][13].

Stay up to date with new Wahat Al-Jalabiya collections on [Facebook][14], [Pinterest][15], [Twitter][16], [ YouTube][17], and their [blog][18].
