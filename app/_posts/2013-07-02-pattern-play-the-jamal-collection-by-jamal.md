#PATTERN PLAY: THE JAMAL COLLECTOIN BY JAMAL AL-NAJADAH

When some people think of Muslim women, they oftentimes envision us wearing all Black clothing. Always. This may be true for some women and there is nothing wrong with doing so. Some feel more comfortable in solid colors and it compliments them well. Then there are those who express their individuality through various choices in color, pattern, and style of clothing. And what better time to show a personal sense of style than at a special event or gathering? If you adore mixing colors, patterns, and embroidery, then The Jamal Collection by Jamal Al-Najadah may become your new obsession.

Based in Kuwait, Jamal deftly combines various fabrics into stunningly elegant garments perfect for any special occasion. She has an expert eye for pattern, color combinations, and textures. Each garment has a refined eclecticism, combining luxurious silks, bright patterns, and trims with surface design techniques like block printing, embroidery, and beading. One cannot help but feel happy in these garments. They are bold, fun, elegant, and comfortable. And it is rare to find a garment with all of these qualities, especially with the quality of comfort. I can definitely see myself hosting a Ramadaan gathering, a Ladies' henna night, a garden party, or even a boutique opening in any of Jamal's dresses.

Here are a few more pieces from her most recent collection:
