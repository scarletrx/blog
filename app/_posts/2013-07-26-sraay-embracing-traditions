#SRAAY: EMBRACING TRADITIONS

Traditions can, at times, seem boorish, limiting, and unnecessary to some younger generations. In this day and age where letter writing and common courtesy seem to be rare virtues, many young people have turned their backs on their respective cultures and traditions, seeking out the most modern and innovative lifestyles available. There is nothing wrong with innovation and technological advancement. But we should never forget or try to erase where we come from because this is the foundation of who we are and who we will become. When designers incorporate traditional techniques and styles to their collections, some succeed in crafting refreshing styles that attract both traditional and modern fashionistas. One brand that has grasped this skill of design is fashion newcomer, SRAAY.

Hailing from Kuwait, SRAAY is a fashion collection designed by two Kuwaiti designers in their early twenties. Despite their youth, the fashion duo are proving age has very little to do with embracing traditions and successfully designing refined collections. SRAAY was established this summer and has already received rave reviews at regional fashion expos, such as the recent [White Expo][2] at [360 Mall][3] in Kuwait.

The designersâ€™ start in fashion began when they were designing garments for themselves. They designed simple summer dresses, modest tops/tunics, and modern twists on kaftan for Ramadaan. Wearing their own designs often, they attracted the attention of many, gaining requests to begin making garments for others. The young designers received an outpouring of support from family and friends and decided to take the leap and start SRAAY. The first collection was a mix of Ramadaan kaftan and dresses, summer maxi dresses, and Eid garments. Their designs feature linens, cottons, chiffons, and nets, embellished with embroidery, lace, prints, and a treasured Kuwaiti traditional textile, sadu weaving. Accessories and handbags will be introduced in their next collection.

Sadu, or [Al-Sadu][4] is a weaving technique that has been used by bedouins in the Arabian pennisula for centuries. One remarkable aspect of this weaving technique is that patterns and instructions are not written down. They memorized and passed down by example and word of mouth. SRAAY incorporates this treasured tribal artform beautifully, embracing Kuwaiti traditions and cultural identity. You can learn about Al-Sadu from the Kuwaiti traditional textile preservation organization, [Bayt al-Sadu (Sadu House).][5]
