#AAMAAL LOVES… THE ABAYA COMPANY

![007][1]

When I go shopping for an abaya, finding one suitable for daily wear can be a challenge. For some unknown reason, a sea of poorly rhinestoned and poorly made abayat swirl before me. And shoulder pads… I have a terrible relationship with shoulder pads. There are rarely any gracefully simple abayat to be found. And when I do find one, I rush to it, only to see, “58”. *sighs* Being a tall woman, seeing any number below 62 is just depressing. But every so often, you are blessed to come across a boutique that caters to their customers’ every need. They listen intently, seeking the customer’s satisfaction over making a quick sale. And today’s featured guest shares one main goal: Keep the customer happy. Allow me to introduce you to Sana, the designer behind THE ABAYA COMPANY.

Based in Dubai,&nbsp;THE ABAYA COMPANY&nbsp;opened in October 2012. Sana’s love of fashion led her to train as a fashion designer. However, instead of marketing to consumers in UAE, she decided to cater to consumers in Europe, the US, and elsewhere outside of the Gulf region. She soon received several orders, especially through her Facebook page. To keep up with the demand without sacrificing quality, Sana curates a mix of her own designs and carefully selected, high-quality ready-to-wear abayat. Customer satisfaction is so important to her that she personally selects each ready-to-wear abaya, examining its construction and quality. In the near future, Sana plans to only feature her own designs, maintaining the same quality she has come to be known for. She includes subtle details,&nbsp;like wrist snaps,&nbsp;in her custom designed garments that many designers seem to overlook. Her embroidery designs compliment each abaya well, providing a unique and stylish garment. I look forward to seeing her upcoming collection soon. Check out more details of&nbsp;THE ABAYA COMPANY&nbsp;collection below:
