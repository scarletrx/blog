# NVIT BLANCHE: The Rituals of Craftsmanship

![Pearl &amp; 22kt Gold Necklace][1]

When I think back on my first trip to a major museum, I fondly remember the collections of ancient jewels. The Egyptians, the Aztecs, the Etruscans—all had their unique language of culture, history, beliefs, and rituals contained within these glittering symbols of existence. Since then, I have been an ancient civilization enthusiast, splitting my time between languages of the tongue and expressions of the mind. I often mention in conversations concerning crafts and craftsmanship that any craft is a tangible expression of the thoughts and experiences of an artisan. Jewellery has been one of the most celebrated and powerful forms of expression for thousands of years.

I am drawn to jewellery because it can be as bold and glamorous or delicate and demure as desired. It is a masterful process of taking raw materials and transforming them into attractive, symbolic mirrors which reflect the personalities, cultures, heritage, beliefs, and tastes of each wearer. In today’s technically-advanced jewellery industry, finding designers who have learned and stuck to the “olde ways” of jewellery making is always a treat. Recently, I came across a designer who specializes in creating jewellery that incorporates ancient cultures, high-purity metals, ancestral materials, and the sciences, such as Astronomy. New York-based designer David Hines of [NVIT BLANCHE][2] has crafted a remarkable collection,&nbsp;creating award-winning, one-of-a-kind pieces desirable to any serious collector and admirer of handcrafted jewellery. The collection includes materials such as Persian and American Turquoise, Afghani Lapis Lazuli, Mediterranean and Japanese precious coral and other high-grade precious gemstones.

David was born in Canada and raised in England, where he studied Philosophy and Art History at the University College London. Afterwards, he moved to New York and began working for several distinguished artists, including Louise Joséphine Bourgeois, the French-American artist and sculptor best known for her spider structures, titled [Maman][5]. After working in the trading industry, David found himself making art again, including jewellery. His background in Philosophy and Art History caused him to carefully contemplate form, structure, materials, and ancient techniques of jewellery making. All of his designs are made by the hands of a small group of artisans in New York. Each piece is a testament to what has been and what will be; a wearable expression of ancient and modern times.

I am especially fond of the Star Maps Collection. It consists of rings made of 20kt Rose Gold and Platinum, each displaying a unique star map for a particular place and time. David explains the intricacy and singularity of each piece, providing an exclusive record of a specific event. He says:

&gt; _ The star maps come from a desire to mark in a specific and unique way, important events. The hexagon shape and astronomy both have a long and revered heritage in Islamic cultural life. The stars shift overhead ever so slightly each day and appear in different patterns depending on our terrestrial vantage point. Each night, a specific set of stars becomes visible overhead and is unique to that time and place. Similar patterns will reappear, but never quite exactly.
&gt;
&gt; In that spirit, the Star Map rings take a strip of stars over a specific place on a specific date and are laid out around the circumference of the ring. In this way, a birth in Riyadh, April 1, 2013, a death in Medina, June 8, 632, and a pilgrimage to Mecca each have their own unique stone setting patterns by marking the stars with diamonds.
&gt;
&gt; _

At the recent 30th Annual Spectrum Awards presented by the American Gem Trade Association (AGTA), David won the [2014 Men’s Wear - Platinum Honors Award][8] for his [Platinum “Bloody Knuckles” rings][9], featuring mirror-set Rubies.
