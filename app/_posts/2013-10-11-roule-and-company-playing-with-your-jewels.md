#ROULE &amp; COMPANY: Playing With Your Jewels

![Roule &amp; Company Octagonal Cocktail Rings][1]

When was the last time you played? Think about it. When was the last time you stepped away from the chaos of life, sat down, and played? As we grow older, we tend to “have” less and less time to play. Those of us who make it a point to get out and play are often pegged as being “childish”. I find this label to be a bit unfair, as the term usually means one is not fully developed or lacking as an adult. Why is playing viewed as an undesirable activity for adults?

In my opinion, setting aside playtime, yes, playtime, throughout the week is an excellent way to get exercise and lessen stress. The more responsibilities we have as an adult, the more stress we gain. Stress is not my friend. When I am stressed, my work suffers, along with much of everything else in my life. As a writer and graphic designer, being stressed while working on a project will greatly reduce my ability to provide engaging solutions. If possible, I will step away from a stressful situation to regroup and change my mood. When I feel well, I work well.

This is where jewelry comes in. Jewelry, you say? You see, I am a magpie when it comes to jewelry, colours, and patterns. They make me happy and I am almost instantly put into a good mood when I take a few minutes to view one of my favourite designers’ new collections or look at photos of new textile patterns for the season and the like. This is part of my playtime. The sparkle, the colours, the design, all of these aspects play a major role in stimulating my mind and as a result, improve my mood and outlook. So you cannot imagine how excited I was when I came across the ROULE &amp; COMPANY, a fine jewelry collection by husband and wife design team Christopher Roule and Laurin Lucaire.

For more than two decades, Christopher has created a collection of innovative and iconic jewelry, using streamlined simplicity, tactile communication, and kinetic movement as his touchstones. ROULE &amp; COMPANY’s signature Shaker designs feature Christopher’s trademark wireform technique, which he has developed and refined for many years. Laurin and Christopher have collaborated on numerous jewelry projects. However, in 2010, Laurin decided to make the leap and trade graphic design for jewelry design. Now her “paper” is gold and her “pixels” are gemstones. Her background in graphic design translates to the world of fine jewelry and compliments Christopher’s linear and geometrical designs very well.

The Wired Collection is an exquisitely crafted collection with a very fun element: loose gemstones. The designs feature anywhere from 5 to 175 carats of loose emeralds, sapphires, rubies, and more, suspended in golden latticework. The ROULE &amp; COMPANY Shaker pieces sparkle and shimmer and are brought to life as you move. This playful, yet elegant design mimics our childhood fascinations with rattles, light, and sound. The collection also includes ROULE &amp; COMPANY’s Star Dust pieces, which feature arrays of brilliant white diamonds that appear to float on a field of blackened gold, reminiscent of constellations in the night sky. The Halo bangles feature bold contrasts and graphic use of coloured gemstones, making them highly collectible statement pieces.

With elements of architecture and industrial design, ROULE &amp; COMPANY’s design aesthetic feels much like the highly disciplined design concepts of an engineer or architect. When asked about their approach to jewelry design, the design duo explained:

&gt; _"We approach each piece dreaming of bridge or a concert hall, building parts that, when assembled as a whole, achieve the elusive balance of function, integrity, and beauty. But since we work in mere fractions of a millimeter, much of this is perceived on an emotional level, perhaps sensed more than physically seen."_

This collection is very exciting. The intricacy of their latticework and movement of the loose carats of precious gemstones seems to mimic the high-rise skyline of New York, where the company is based. Just as light shines down upon the city, causing a glittering interplay between light, shadow, steel, and form. Wearing a ROULE &amp; COMPANY piece is like wearing your own personal rose window, like the [South Rose Window][4] of the Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris. I cannot help but be in awe of the way the gemstones move and sparkle within their gilded cages. As a lover of geometry, this collection resembles several layers of geometric grids, puzzles that are not meant to solved but observed. Roule and Lucaire have mastered the effect of art that is as beautiful on display as it is when worn. Yet, to wear a ROULE &amp; COMPANY piece is to interact with the art and truly make it your own. Check out some of my favorite pieces from the WIRED Collection below:
