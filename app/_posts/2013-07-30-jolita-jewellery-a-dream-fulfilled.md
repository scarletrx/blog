"Dreams are your subconscious working out problems and creating inspiration…" I fondly remember a close relative mentioning this to me when I told them of an interesting dream I had the previous evening. There are several books and theories that have been written concerning dreams, why they occur, what they mean, and how can we incorporate them into our lives for positive psychological reinforcement and change. Additionally, artists have pulled from their dreams for as long as art has been in existence. For instance, if you have ever listened to the title-cut, ["Leap of Faith"][2] by singer [Kenny Loggins][3], it was written from several dreams he had over a period of time.

At times, some seem to discourage learning and building from dreams. However, I believe we should use our dreams to create goals we can work toward and provide ourselves a sense of purpose to push past living an ordinary life. Seeking an extraordinary life requires going out of our comfort zones, welcoming uncertainty, and work through our fears to achieve our goals. The nature of design requires designers to recognize fears and work through them to achieve desired goals. In many ways, I believe some nightmares are visions of our fears and some dreams are roadmaps to defeating those fears. Inspiration is almost always found in the oddest places, and one designer who embraces being inspired by his dreams is Lithuanian-born jewelry designer Algis Abromaitis of JOLITA JEWELLERY.

One week in 2008, Algis had a recurring dream about a bracelet. The dream became so tiring that near the end of the week, he asked a friend to take him to a bead shop so he could buy materials to make a bracelet. After visiting the bead shop, he has been making jewelry ever since. With encouragement from his sister, Jolita, the brand’s co-founder and namesake, Algis decided to make his passion a business. Working from his design studio in London, he meticulously makes each piece offered, opulent, vividly colored statement jewelry in the form of bracelets, earrings, cuffs, and more. Each piece included hand-dyed silks and hand-painted rhinestones, all done by Algis himself. He also includes new and vintage materials from around the world. His method of design creates a collection where no pieces are alike, adding a sense of exclusivity and luxury to the line.

From years of traveling, Algis decided to give JOLITA JEWLELLERY the Latin slogan, “Urbi et Orbi”, which means, “To the city and to the World.” When he finally settled in London, he recalled how young men entering Rome for the first-time were greeted:

&gt; _"When a young man came to Rome for the first time, he was greeted by a Roman with a saying "Urbi et Orbi" which meant welcome to Rome and to the World as in those days Rome was one of the greatest cities in the world. So for me London was my Rome. I came to London, which opened the gates to world."_

The designer finds inspiration from vibrant flowers, bugs, skulls, teeth, museums, history, mythology, and everywhere in between. He incorporates unusual items like skulls and bugs into his pieces from his love of Momento Mori jewelry, which was very popular during the Victorian Era. Momento Mori jewelry incorporates human hair of the deceased into intricate pieces of jewelry to honor their memory and as a reminder that we all will be touched by death. Upon examining the brand’s statement necklaces, one can see the braided hand-dyed silk represents the of human hair that was used in Momento Mori pieces, along with Algis’ love of vibrant flowers. Finding tiny bees and bejeweled skulls in Algis’ sparkling pieces causes each piece to become lovely example of “everything is not as it seems”. I believe Algis has created a wonderfully exquisite modern twist on momento mori jewelry.

Momento Mori is a genre of art that has been used a motivation for living life to the fullest capacity. Bloggers Brett and Kate McKay of [The Art of Manliness][4], mention the phrase, which means “Remember death” in Latin, possibly came from an ancient Roman tradition in which a servant would be tasked with standing behind a victorious general as he paraded though town. As the general basked in the glory of the cheering crowds, the servant would whisper in the general’s ear:

&gt; _Latin: “Respice post te! Hominem te esse memento! Memento mori!” _
&gt;
&gt; Translated: “Look behind you! Remember that you are but a man! Remember that you will die!”

I was first introduced to JOLITA JEWELLERY over a year ago on [BOTICCA][5], a site where independent designers can sell their products to a global audience. I am so glad to see how far Algis and Jolita have come with their brand. The collection makes me smile and one can’t help but feel happy when wearing one of Algis’ beautiful creations.
