We love featuring exquisite discoveries from Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Gulf States. Not from these areas? Excellent! We would be honoured to hear from you. No matter where a discovery is found, if we love it, we will feature it.
<br />
<br />
We do not trade product for feature. Our acceptance of an item or product does not guarantee a feature. If we love it, we *will* feature it.
