UMAYAMU is a collection of exquisite discoveries from Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Gulf States, curated by luxury lifestyle writer, Aamaal Abdul-Malik. Not from these areas? Excellent! We would be honoured to hear from you. No matter where a discovery is found, if we love it, we will feature it.

We do not trade product for feature. Our acceptance of an item or product does not guarantee a feature. If we love it, we will feature it.
