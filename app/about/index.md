Hi, my name is Aamaal. Welcome to UMAYAMU, a curated collection of things I have found while working as a luxury lifestyle writer. I have always had an affinity for beautiful things. Discovering beauty in areas like Africa, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and Asia is especially entertaining as these locales provide intriguing studies of the intersections of traditions, modernity, and the evolution of cultural thought and expression. As Curator of UMAYAMU, I present discoveries of beauty in fashion, jewellery, accessories, and more. My purpose is to add value and meaning that goes beyond the physical attractions of these discoveries, to reveal the dedicated artisans, talented designers, and historical and cultural influences behind some of the worldâ€™s most beautiful things.

As an advocate of sustainability, I stay abreast of the newest developments in sustainable luxury fashion, accessories, interiors, and destinations. I firmly believe sustainability and luxury can co-exist to form beautifully rich experiences. The key is mindfulness. Designers and producers have amazing opportunities to encourage mindfulness through the creation, production, marketing, and purchasing of their work. I feel it is my responsibility to continue this encouragement by telling stories of the makers, their materials, and how sustainable planning and processes can enrich the beauty and well-being of society and the environment.

In addition to UMAYAMU, I contribute to Eat Love Savor Magazine, writing about rare and stunning jewellery, timepieces, and housewares. At Sweet Modesty, I write about breathtakingly elegant traditional fashion from Africa and the Middle East.
