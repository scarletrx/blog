excerpt: "The final result of all this is MEMORIS: a 46 mm timepiece, available in pink gold or white gold, in three limited editions of just 60 pieces each. Embodying the essence of true commemoration – all the life of the present, rooted in history – it links Louis Moinet’s heritage with the creative vision of the Ateliers that today honour his memory."

For some, a watch is merely a manner of getting to appointments on time, keeping track of their busy schedule in the pursuit of living a full and satisfying life. For others, only the most beautiful timepiece will do to serve as a heirloom for generations to come. And still for others, the measurement of time is an art in of itself; the alchemy of both art and science, employed to arrive at a beautifully engineered instrument to measure even the minutest increments of time. I have always enjoyed history, reading of civilizations long past, gleaning insight, wisdom, and wonder from the study of ideals still very relevant today. But when I was introduced to the world of horology five years ago, it was if I had stumbled upon a land of insurmountable wonders and innovation. I discovered an area of study that melded my love of art, math, sculpture, fine jewellery, and engineering into some of the most innovative instruments I have ever seen, as beautiful inside as they are without. And I have been enchanted ever since. 

In my opinion, refined taste in timepieces can provide an introspective example of the appreciation of quality, design, and craftsmanship. This level of attentiveness requires a high measure of consideration. True luxury goods are built upon the foundation of intellectual curiosity. In this way, I have found a kindred spirit in Louis Moinet, noted master watchmaker, sculptor, painter, and inventor of the chronograph. His love for knowledge in both science and art are well documented. And his love of self-improvement was only matched by his acumen for masterful innovation. He was an artist in the purest sense and devoted his life to elevating the measurement of time to be beautiful in function and design. This pursuit afforded him many famed customers including Napoleon Bonaparte, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and his dearest friend and collaborator, Abraham-Louis Breguet, master horologist and founder of Breguet.

But Moinet’s most treasured innovation, the Moinet compteur de tierces, was not recognized for its tremendous advancements in engineering and accuracy in his lifetime. Now at the bicentenary of his greatest achievement, the Louis Moinet atelier celebrates his innovation and their tenth anniversary with their own innovation, the Memoris, the world’s first chronograph timepiece. This timepiece is a masterful tribute to the Moinet legacy of innovative horology. The chronograph function is the heart of the timepiece, on display for all to see. In addition to this sheer beauty in form and function of this custom designed chronograph, its “Energie Plus” automatic pawl winding system allows the timepiece to be wound in both directions while maintaining a level of precision and accuracy unseen within any timepiece currently made. In essence, the chronograph is the main function of the timepiece and the measurement of time is the complication. And this turns the current idea and definition of a luxury timepiece almost inside out. Where once chronograph complications were unseen, Ateliers Louis Moinet has masterfully made this function the focal point of the piece, harkening back to Moinet’s main pursuit: to create a masterful timepiece, beautifully innovative in function as it is in form. 

On this most wondrous occasion, Ateliers Louis Moinet has crafted 3 limited editions and 60 copies of the Memoris. Available in 18K pink, white rhodium-plated, and white-blued gold, the Memoris is a true testament to the innovative spirit and dedication of one of the most masterfully talented watchmakers to have ever lived.
